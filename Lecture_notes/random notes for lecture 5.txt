max U(C, L) s.t. C <= wh_m + V + f(h_n); L + h_m + h_n = T
C, h_m, h_n

the C constraint implies: 
C <= w(T - L - h_n) + V + f(H_n)

the T constraint:
h_m = T - L - h_n

L = U(C, L) + lambda[w(T - L - h_n) + V + f(h_n) - C]

C: MU_c = lambda
L: MU_l = lambda*w
h_n: -lambda*w + lambda*f(h_n) = 0
f'(h_n) = w
MRS_LC = f'(h_n) = w

Each hour of work yields the same consumption value at the margin

f'(0) > w
person enters into home production
home production then continues at a decreasing marginal utility until the point where:
f'(h*_n) = w

a wage increase leads to a decrease in non-market work, ambiguous effects on market work and leisure
----depends on size of substitution and income effects

washing machine
one is bought----this can be modelled as an increase in f(0), and a decrease in f'(h_n) perhaps to zero----reduction in the amount of non-market work available to be done
non-market work decreases, increase in leisure, market work could potentially go up since all non-market work was switched

higher female LFPR and lower fertility in past decades
now: we can model f(h_n) as child production
--wages have increased, that should decrease home production
--but decreases in fertility could be driving increased labor supply (lower f'(h_n) with fewer kids around))

we can break this apart with instrumental variables
